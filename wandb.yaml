  # TCN_CHANNELS might be more complex to sweep directly if the number of layers changes.
  # For simplicity, keeping it fixed or sweeping individual channel sizes if structure is fixed.
  # Example for fixed structure, sweeping first channel size:
  # TCN_CHANNELS_0:
  #   values: [32, 64]
  # TCN_CHANNELS_1:
  #   values: [32, 64]
  # You would need to modify your script to construct TCN_CHANNELS from these.
  # For now, we assume TCN_CHANNELS is fixed as per the script or you'll adjust the script.

# To run the sweep, you would typically use:
# 1. wandb sweep wandb.yaml
# 2. Copy the command output by `wandb sweep` (e.g., wandb agent <sweep_id>) and run it.
# Ensure your script `model_testing_1.py` is set up to accept these hyperparameters
# from `wandb.config` when a sweep is running.
# The script already logs these parameters to wandb.config, so it should pick them up
# if they are passed by the wandb agent.
